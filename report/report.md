# FPGA UART ALU

https://github.com/ericbreh/fpga-uart-alu

## Step 1 -- UART Echo

### 1.3

#### Waveform that verifies the UART modules are connected correctly

The first signal is the output of the testing `uart_tx` instance. The second and third signals are the `rx` and `tx` signals of the alu. The forth signal is the input of the testing `uart_tx` instance. The `rx` and `tx` signals of the alu are connected to each other, which is shown in the waveform. The values `85, 0, 255, 1` being transmitted and received.

### 1.8

#### Waveform that verifies the UART modules synthesized correctly

This waveform shows the same testbench as `1.3`, but after synthesis. It also only shows the signals from the testing `uart_tx` instance.

### Difficulties

Some difficulties faced in this section included:

* Installing all of the nessacary tools and software
* Getting the Verilog project structure set up
* Using a PLL to get a correct clock-frequency

## Step 2 -- Packets Over UART

### Python script connecting to the FPGA and sending packets

### Difficulties

Some difficulties faced in this section included:

* Timing errors
* Debugging the Python script used to send packets and receive data

## Step 3 -- Sending Operations Over UART

| Operation | Opcode |
| --------- | ------ |
| ECHO      | 0xEC   |
| ADD       | 0xAD   |
| MUL       | 0x88   |
| DIV       | 0xD1   |

### Difficulties

Some difficulties faced in this section included:

* Debugging the Python script used for sending packets and testing

## Step 4 -- ALU RTL

### Waveform demonstrating that packets are transmitted, and replies are received

This shows 3 operations being sent

| Operation | Inputs (Dec) | Inputs (Hex) | Output (Dec) | Output (Hex) |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| ADD       | 1, 2         | 0x01, 0x02   | 3            | 0x03         |
| MUL       | 3, 4         | 0x03, 0x04   | 12           | 0x0C         |
| DIV       | 10, 2        | 0x0A, 0x02   | 5            | 0x05         |

### Difficulties

Some difficulties faced in this section included:

* Not understanding the ready valid system used in the third party multiplication and division modules
